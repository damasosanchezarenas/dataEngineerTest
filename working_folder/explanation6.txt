Hello I am Damaso,

In this .txt I am going to explain the steps I have followed to create the crontab with docker.

1. The first thing I do is create a script.sh (in a very simple way) where I call the.py files created in working_folder.

2. Later I create a crontab that calls this script.sh. This is where I must indicate how often I want it to run.

3. I create a DockerFile where I indicate that I want to execute the crontabasd


[HOW USE IT]

1. Build from the Dockerimage:

	$ sudo docker build --rm -t docker-cron .

2. Run the docker container in the background (docker returns the id of the container):

	$ sudo docker run -t -i -d docker-cron
	b149b5e7306dba492558c7024809f13cfbb616cccd0f4020db61bf715f4db836

3. Check it in /optional6/cron.log

[HOW TO MODIFY THE INTERVAL]

1. To change the interval the cron job is runned, just simply edit the crontab file. 
Currently, the job is runned every day at 2.30.
